# One-off scripts

** Note these will almost certainly not work for you without modification


## What are these?
This is mainly system scripts and helpful snippets to automate machine tasks for my own workflow. Yes I could have made them work for other distros and systems, and more generalized. I didn't. This is sufficient enough for my needs and when my system changes I may very well need to change these, too.

That said, the development was fast and simple and the code is clear and that's good enough for now.
